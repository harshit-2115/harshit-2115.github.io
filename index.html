<h1>First of all, thanks a lot for this particular question. I really wanted to share the decisions I made and the consequences I faced.

A few things I want to share before I share my decisions.

I did a core programming course when I was 13. 
I was one of the toppers in school till 10th grade.
Because I was interested in coding I chose to go for science stream and then to an engineering college.
Like every other science student, I joined a JEE entrance coaching institute. My 2 year program was school-integrated so I changed my school after 10th grade.

Now the decisions(consciously or unconsciously taken):

1. Chasing the toppers
During my JEE preparation, I was continuosly trying to copy the students from the top batches in my institute. I used the buy the books they used to study from. My friend was in one such batch. I even bought a voice recorder and gave it to him to record his classes. I was never focused on what the teachers in my batch were teaching. 

Consequence: After JEE 2017 results, few students from my batch made it to good colleges and few students from the top batches failed to even qualify. I failed at making it to an IIT or some other prestigious institute. 

I cant be sure but I think blindly copying others was one of the reasons I failed. Because I was always a topper, I had this ego in me, I always thought I am supposed to be in the top batches.Instead of working hard and scoring good marks in quarter exams to qualify for top batches I was blindly copying other students.


2. Dropping out from college.
I was selected into Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering(IT Stream).I was not satisfied with my performance in the JEE exam still I chose to move on and start with my college life.My father wanted me to join his business because we came to know that average packages from my college were around 3-4 lpa and he didnt want me to go for a job. For the first few weeks I was attending all classes, taking notes and studying hard. One thing I observed is that most students were sitting in classes just for the attendance record and almost everyone used to start studying just 2-3 days before the exams.A few weeks later, attending classes was the most unproductive thing I was doing. In first semester, I was doing carpentry and making engineering graphics sheets.I hated doing this. Then, I stopped going to college. I used to code all day and attend coding classes from a private institute. I started worrying. I used to think about giving JEE another try, applying to foreign universities and joining my father's business and getting a correspondence degree. My decision was leaving college and joining my father's business and focusing on coding only. So before first year exams I dropped out. My father owns a textile manufacturing firm in Surat, Gujarat. He handles sales in Delhi and his partners handle the manufacturing part. I went to Surat, for the first few months I was working 10-11 hours per day. I learnt creating embroidery designs in computer and how the embroidery machines work.People were so good at lying there. I learnt how to handle people.In Surat, every teenage boy I met was getting his degree from correspondence and was into his father's business. They were so content about this. I came back to Delhi for a couple of months for my first sem exams. It was in these months that I realised that I took the easy way out. I was rarely coding. I met my friends who were learning different skills and exploring. Everyone was managing classes with their outside courses. They were appearing in interviews.In other words, everyone was hustling. 

3. Leaving father's business
After almost a year in my father's business, I was doing great. Father said that I will be able to handle my own firm in just one more year. He was appreciating my hard work. But I was like then what ? We were in a wedding in Surat. The bridegroom was the son of my father's friend.He was just 23. He was also into his father's business and was doing great. There I was like why is he getting married, he is just 23. My father and  I were discussing about this when he said that he will also get me married my 23-24. I was like who are you to get me married ? I am blunt when someone is trying to control my life. I started realising the values based on which people behave. My father's values are earning money, controling the family and following everything your parents say. I left his business, came back to Delhi and was in regret for a couple on months for not studying enough for JEE and dropping out of college. There were no options left. I thought a correspondence degree is of no value. Everyone said that I am leaving what other people crave for, a well settled business. I was spending days at home, watching spiritual videos, reading articles because I wanted to calm my mind and wanted someone to tell me that there is still some chance.We went to a conselor, he gave me some questions as homework. One question was about the priorities in life. My priority was doing something on my own.There is a huge difference in thinking something and writing on paper. Now, I never decide anything without pen and paper.I left college not because I wanted to join my father's business. I left because the classes were of no value. I wanted to study coding and the subjects were boring so I thought I can learn business and coding and then some startups. My father accepted that I don't want to do his business. He then wanted me to join some regular college, I was wasting time sitting at home.Then I went to my maths teacher from my old school. We were really close. But I dont know why I didnt consult him before dropping out of college. Maybe because I knew he wouldn't let me, and I wanted to escape. 
He told me to continue coding, I met his other students who were working as data scientists, software engineers but has degrees from mechanical and chemical streams. Now I am revising my coding concepts, preparing for a hackathon, started my CAT coaching. 


I am just 19 and It is okay if you dont know what do you want as your career. Most students(even IITians) drastically change their streams after graduation. Everyone in engineering colleges is into coding irrespective of their streams. I started coding because no major investment is required and you can make a huge impact. We have examples like Facebook,Airbnb, Uber and Amazon. A few of such companies are facing losses but they made an impact.
